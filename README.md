Title: Modular and Configurable Internet of Things Devices for Value Chain Digitalization

Abstract. Nowadays, value chainsâ€™ volatility and increasing need for digitalization, whether for transparency or so that they can be optimized, forces companies to reduce the time and costs of developing Internet of Things (IoT) devices for monitoring processes and products in these same chains. Thus, the proposed work explores developing a modular and configurable architecture for IoT devices in digitizing value chains. By adopting a human-centric approach, the modular architecture enables devices to be adapted to meet specific needs at different value chain stages, from material and subproduct transportation to processing and final product distribution. The benefits of configurability are highlighted, allowing for customized adjustments based on the requirements of the process, transporter, or product being digitalized. Technical challenges and strategies to ensure interoperability and practical implementation are discussed. This work provides insights into how modular and configurable IoT devices can drive the digitalization of the value chains, allowing flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the supply chain. At the end of the work, a first approach is presented with the studied concepts, involving creating and testing some IoT devices.
